Stilt Guys

-Fall off when jumped on, turning into normal Shy Guys

Shy Squad
---------
-Counts as a single enemy
-Has 15 HP, with each Shy Guy representing 1 HP
  -When damaged, the number of Shy Guys correlating to the amount of damage are removed from the squad (Ex. 4 damage means 4 Shy Guys are removed)

-Battle position is the topmost Shy Guy
-Attack power correlates to how many there are on the stack (Max Attack = 4, Min Attack = 1)
-Can knock off the bottom-most Shy Guy with Spin Smash. If successful, will knock off the one it hits into as well
-Can also knock off the bottom-most Shy Guy with Kooper's Shell moves

Cleft
-----
-Flipped over with an explosion (TTYD) for 2 turns. When flipped, Defense goes to 0. After the turns are up, it gets back up
  -Its base Defense likely stays the same and its Defense modifier is subtracted by its base Defense to equal 0. Defense-boosting
   and Defense-lowering effects still apply while it's flipped
-Explosive Payback with Hold Fast does not cause them to flip over

Bristle
-------
-Pops its spikes out when approached with a move. Moves include Hammer, Gulp, or anything that gets near.
-Having Spike Shield equipped allows Mario to approach them with Hammer
-Flipped over with an explosion. Spikes on the bottom still protect it from jumps, and spikes on the side still prevent it from being approached
  -Also flipped over with Quake Hammer and a POW Block
  -However, an Earth Quake does NOT flip them over
-Not flipped with Explosive Payback via Hold Fast
-When Immobilized, spikes don't pop out, allowing them to be approached
  -Same with Frozen and Sleep
  -Interestingly, same with Confusion and Dizzy!
-When their spikes don't pop out due to immobilization or similar status effects, they're still spiky, as Ms. Mowz' Kiss Thief won't work but
 Mario's Hammer and Yoshi's Gulp do
-Asleep for 5 turns
-Like jumping on spiked enemies, their side spikes will still damage you if you're Invisible
-Koops can attack them without their spikes interrupting him with his shell moves

Paragoomba
----------
-In PM, loses wings when hit with the Hammer from a First Strike
