Move Information (1/17/17)
--------------------------
Here's where detailed information about specific moves and features will be documented.

Partner General
---------------
In PM, if a partner takes damage they'll be inflicted with Injured, which is a subset
of Immobilized that does the same thing.

Watt
----
Electro Dash - Doesn't deal contact damage (can hit Pokeys and spiked enemies)
Power Shock - Inflict Paralyzed, which is a subset of Immobilized.
Mega Shock - Inflicts Paralyzed, which is a subset of Immobilized.

Message for both: "Your enemy's paralyzed and can't move!"

Turbo Charge - Gives Mario Turbo Charge, which adds 1 Attack to Mario. This is a subset
of POWUp.

Message: "Your attack power will go up for a short time!"
Remove message: "Your attack power has returned to normal!"

Sushie
------
Water Block - Adds 1 Defense to Mario AND adds a +1 Resistance to Fire. This is a
separate, unique Status Effect.

Message: "Mario will be protected by Water Block for a short time!"
Remove message: "The Water Block's effect has worn off!"

Lakilester
----------
Cloud Nine - Gives Mario Cloud Nine, which is a subset of Dodgy. Unsure of evasion increase,
but seems less than 50%.

Confirmed thanks to Jdaster64: Cloud Nine grants a 50% chance of evasion

Message: "Chances of being attacked will decrease!"
Remove message: "The effect of Cloud Nine have worn off!"

Notes: If Mario is inflicted with Stone, Lakilester will come down and scoop him up
instead of Mario jumping onto the cloud.

Spin Smash
----------
Using Spin Smash on Kent C. Koopa's Tail when he's flipped over causes him to drop 6 coins, which then are
added to your total in battle shortly afterwards. This can be repeated.

Bowser
------
Shockwave Drain (Star Rod wave attack) - Removes all positive Status Effects on Mario (and presumably his Partner if this were in TTYD)
Power Up - Removes all negative Status Effects on Bowser, makes him Invincible, and doubles the power of all attacks except Shockwave Drain

Bandits/Big Bandits/Badge Bandits
---------------------------------
Their ram attack has a chance at stealing:

-Bandits: Coins
-Big Bandits: Coins or an Item
-Badge Bandits: Badges

Stolen Message: "Your (thing) was\n stolen!"

Examples: "Your Coin was\n stolen!", "Your Lucky Day was\n stolen!"

Ms. Mowz
--------
Kiss Thief - Can steal any held collectible, including ones stolen from Bandits.

Steal Message: "You stole\n a (thing)!";

Examples: "You stole\n a Power Plus!", "You stole\n a Tasty Tonic!"

Bow
---
Smack - Deals contact damage (can't hit Pokeys)
Fan Smack - Doesn't deal contact damage (can hit Pokeys)

Yoshi
-----
Stampede - Attacks enemies on the ground, in the air, and on the ceiling despite the description stating only ground enemies

Flurrie
-------
Gale Force (courtesy of Jdaster64) - Effectiveness is based off the following formula:

(Bar fullness) * (Enemy Susceptibility)% + (Player Level - Enemy Level)%

For example, a Level 30 Mario that got a full bar in Gale Force against a Hyper Goomba:
1.00 * 80% + (30 - 15)% = 95%

Clock Out
---------
-Has a 1x multiplier if the bar is filled at all and a 1.27x multiplier if the bar is full
-Can target the Audience (the only move to do so outside bosses)
-If the Audience is hit with it, they go to sleep like when a Crazee Dayzee in the Audience puts everyone to sleep
  -The Audience wakes up on the next phase cycle (so after the enemy's turn on the current phase cycle)

Power Lift
----------
-It takes hitting 5 icons of a stat to boost it up by one. This is constant regardless of how much the stat is boosted
-Hitting Poison Mushrooms slows the cursor down to roughly 1/4 its speed. You can still hit stat icons to boost them
  
Showstopper
-----------
-Has a .5x base multiplier
-The multiplier is increased by .1x for each successful button set, totaling a 1x multiplier since there are 5 button sets
-Available buttons: A, B, X, Y

Earth Quake (item)
------------------
-Deals 5 damage
-Does not flip over any enemies
-Can attack both ground and ceiling enemies despite the description stating only ground-based enemies

General
-------
For the Cloud Nine, Water Block, and Turbo Charge Status Effects, it shows the order
they take place in with their icons on the upper-left side of the screen.

The order is:
1. Water Block
2. Cloud Nine
3. Turbo Charge

This has been confirmed by performing their Action Commands better or worse to inflict
them for different durations and synchronize their turn counts with each other. They
ended, with the Battle Messages appearing, in the order above.

Water Block happens before Poison, Electrified, and Invisible.
Cloud Nine happens before Poison, Electrified, and Invisible.
Turbo Charge happens before Poison, Electrified, and Invisible.

Poison happens before Electrified and Invisible.
