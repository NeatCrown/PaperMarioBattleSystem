New Badge Ideas (7/27/16)
-------------------------
With this system, we can create new Badges that the original games don't have.
This file serves as a brainstorming session for new types of Badges that I'd like to implement.

Superguard Plus
---------------
BP: 7
Description: Increases the damage of Mario's Superguards by 1.

Superguard Plus P
-----------------
BP: 7
Description: Increases the damage of your Partner's Superguards by 1.

Fire Jump
---------
BP: 3
FP Cost: 3 FP
Description: Wear this to use Fire Jump. 3 FP are required to use this attack, which lets you stomp on a foe to deal fire damage with a chance to burn.
Wearing two or more of these badges requires more FP for the move, but enemies stay burned for longer. 

Unlock P
--------
BP: 5
Description: Unlocks your Partner's hidden potential and gives them each a new move they can use in battle.

Notes: Gives Flurrie her unused thunder attack ("Drop lightning on all enemies. As a bonus, you might become electrified.")
as well as giving one new move (TBD) to every other Partner. The new moves will require FP.
Only one of these badges will exist.
