Corrected Turn Order Logic (10/17/16)
-------------------------------------
The recent implementation of swapping Partners highlighted flaws in how the turn order is determined for BattleEntities with multiple turns.

I will be performing tests in TTYD to see the behaviors of turn switching. I will list my predictions of how TTYD handles specific cases
and document the results. After those results, I'll then decide how to recreate that logic with the current system we have in place.

1. The character (Mario or Parter) in back cannot go until the character in front has used up all of his/her turns.
If the character in front gains a new turn while the character in back still has a turn (Ex. Goombella's Rally Wink),
the character in front will go.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: I was correct. The test I did involved inflicting Fast on Goombella via cheats, then using Mario's turn and
using Rally Wink on him. Mario went instead of Goombella. Interestingly, on Mario's turn after Rally Wink, I was
unable to switch Goombella in front despite both Mario and Goombella having turns remaining, which I think is an
oversight they didn't care to fix considering how hard it is to actually get a player character inflicted with Fast.

2. Enemies do not follow the logic from above. For examplem if Beldam, who is always last in the battles she's in, inflicts Fast
on Marilyn, Marilyn will not go. Similarly, if a Koopatrol summons another Koopatrol in front of him, the new Koopatrol will not go.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: I was correct for the first example. The second example holds true in both PM and TTYD, even if the new Koopatrol is summoned
behind the one who called him.

3. When a character dies when it's not their turn and gets revived with a Life Shroom, that character still goes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: Correct for players at least, as I haven't tested with enemies. I put Goombella in Peril and had Mario
use Quake Hammer in Twilight Trail to make the background props fall down and bring Goombella down to 0 HP.
After being revived, Goombella went.

Additional Notes
----------------
-From what I observed, Rally Wink does not actually grant the Fast status, as using it when Mario already has Fast
will still give him another turn. When a status effect is inflicted on someone that already has that status, the
timer for the status refreshes. This leads me to believe that Rally Wink simply adds 1 to Mario's max turn count.

Solutions
---------
Based on the above tests, I think we need to make the following changes to turn order:

-After any player character turn, check if the player in front has a turn, then check if the player in back has a turn.
Switch the turn to that player. The end of the Player phase occurs when neither the front nor the back player has a turn.
-After any enemy turn, check if the current enemy has a turn. If not, find the next enemy with a turn and set the enemy turn value to that one.
-For enemies that were spawned (via Koopatrol summon or some other method), set their current turn count to their max turn count to prevent
them from going

Partner Turn Count
------------------
Partners are unique to any other type of entity in the first two Paper Mario games because they can be switched
out for another one. They also share many properties amongst each other, such as the effects of P Badges.

I tested partner turn count in the following scenario, without Quick Change equipped:
-Vivian was inflicted with Fast, Yoshi was not
-When switching from Vivian to Yoshi, Yoshi had another turn left
-However, when switching from Yoshi to Vivian, Vivian did not have another turn left

With Quick Change (Yoshi was inflicted with Fast and Vivian wasn't this time):
-When switching from Yoshi to Vivian, Vivian had 2 turns left
-When switching from Vivian to Yoshi, Yoshi had 1 turn left
-Switching back to the original partner that was out at the start of the phase yielded the same number of turns regardless
-Using Mario to switch from Yoshi back to Vivian, Vivian had no turns left

A few things to note based off this data:

1. The number of turns all partners have is determined by the number of turns the current partner out at the start
of the Player phase has
2. Partner turns are shared. If one Partner has already used up all of its turns, no other Partners are able to
move until the next Player phase
