Remaining Damage System Implementation (8/7/16)
-----------------------------------------------
Here's a list of things left to implement before the damage system is complete:

1. Simplifier/Unsimplifier - More robust Action Command timing will be necessary, as these modify the windows
   for executing the Action Commands
   
2. All Or Nothing - This ties in with 1 in that the Action Commands will need to be more robust. In this case,
   we'll need to add to the total damage dealt if the Action Command was successfully performed and set it to 0
   if the Action Command was failed. The 0 damage can't be affected by weaknesses/resistances or anything else to make it positive.
   
3. Guarding/Superguarding - On a Guard, the damage of the attack itself is reduced by 1. On a Superguard, the damage Mario takes is 0
   no matter what. Damage Dodge Badges add to Mario's Defense and thus are ineffective against Piercing attacks.
   
4. Double Pain & Last Stand - The formula for Double Pain is: Damage * (# of Double Pains equipped + 1)
   The formula for Last Stand is: Damage / (# of Last Stands equipped + 1); this is rounded down in PM and up in TTYD. Let's go with the latter.
   Double Pain is calculated first. Then, if Mario is in Danger or Peril, Last Stand is factored in.
   
Update (8/20/16)
----------------
5. Damage Dodge - Increases your Defense by 1 for each equipped, but only when you have successfully Guarded and only for the move you Guarded.
   Since it increases your Defense, it does not reduce the damage of Piercing moves. For example, a Crazee Dayzee in TTYD has an Attack of 2,
   and its Sing move deals Piercing damage. Guarding with or without any Damage Dodge badges equipped causes it to do 1 damage since only the
   Guard action reduces the damage of the attack.
