Things To Test (3/9/17)
-----------------------
Here's a simple list of things to test in the first two Paper Mario games.

Pokey Parts
-----------
Which moves remove a Pokey part, and which other enemies have properties that act similar?
Stilt Guys might be worth looking into.

Payback and Invincibility
--------------------------
How does Payback work with true invincibility? The Shadow Queen doesn't have any contact moves, so test on Bowser in PM.
Test with Zap Tap equipped and note the differences of when he stomps on you with and without his Star Rod powers in effect.
The Iron Clefts in TTYD don't take any Payback damage whatsoever, and Superguarding their attacks causes them to recoil back with no damage
instead of getting damaged and playing their hurt animation like other Clefts.

Since there's no Superguarding in PM, it looks like the only instance of Superguarding an invincible enemy is the Iron Clefts. Look for more
invincible enemies to make sure.
