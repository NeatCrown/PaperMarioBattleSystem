Things To Test (3/9/17)
-----------------------
Here's a simple list of things to test in the first two Paper Mario games.

Pokey Parts
-----------
Which moves remove a Pokey part, and which other enemies have properties that act similar?
Stilt Guys might be worth looking into.

Results: 
-Shy Stacks act very similar and can have Shy Guys knocked off using Spin Smash or Kooper's Shell moves
-Super and Ultra Hammer also removes these parts
  -Knocking another enemy with one of these moves Pokey also removes a part. The same occurs with Spin Smash and Shy Stacks
-Kooper:
  -Shell Toss removes these parts
  -Power Shell removes these parts
  -Dizzy Shell doesn't remove any parts
  -Fire Shell removes these parts
-Koops:
  -Shell Toss removes these parts
  -Power Shell removes these parts
  -Shell Slam does NOT remove these parts
-If a Spike Top is Confused and attacks a Pokey, it WON'T remove a part
-Parakarry's Shell Shot doesn't remove a part
-A failed Spin Smash doesn't remove a part. A failed Super and Ultra Hammer also doesn't remove a part
  
Payback and Invincibility
--------------------------
How does Payback work with true invincibility? The Shadow Queen doesn't have any contact moves, so test on Bowser in PM.
Test with Zap Tap equipped and note the differences of when he stomps on you with and without his Star Rod powers in effect.
The Iron Clefts in TTYD don't take any Payback damage whatsoever, and Superguarding their attacks causes them to recoil back with no damage
instead of getting damaged and playing their hurt animation like other Clefts.

Since there's no Superguarding in PM, it looks like the only instance of Superguarding an invincible enemy is the Iron Clefts. Look for more
invincible enemies to make sure.

Results:

Without Star Rod
----------------
-Bowser stomps on Mario, then takes recoil damage and bounces off in a manner similar to when he uses his claw attack
-Most interesting of all, it DOESN'T inflict NoSkills and remove an ability for Mario, even though it wasn't Guarded

With Star Rod
-------------
-Bowser stomps on Mario, ignoring Zap Tap completely
-Like normal, it inflicts NoSkills and removes an ability for Mario

Invincibility and Debuffs
-------------------------
Does debuffing Bowser in PM with Chill Out cause him to have -3 attack when he reactivates his Star Rod powers again?

Result: No. Bowser's Star Rod powers immediately remove all Status Effects he's afflicted with.


Life Shrooms and NoSkills
-------------------------
Do Life Shrooms take effect if items are disabled with NoSkills?

Result: Yes, they do.

Healing Resistances and Invincibility
-------------------------------------
Do invincible enemies with a healing resistance still heal when you attack them with an element that heals them?
Test on Ice Puffs in TTYD with the Invincible attribute modifier code applied to them.

Result: No, since you deal no damage

Can Ms. Mowz steal stolen Coins, Items, or Badges from Bandits and Badge Bandits?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: Yes, she can steal Coins, Items, and Badges back!

Allergic and KO Statuses
------------------------
Does an enemy with Allergic prevent it from being KOed with Showstopper?

Result: Yes! Allergic prevents all Status Effects, including the ones inflicted by Fright Masks, Gale Force, and Showstopper.
All of these moves were tested numerous times on a Spiked Goomba afflicted with Allergic, and it wasn't affected by any of those statuses.
