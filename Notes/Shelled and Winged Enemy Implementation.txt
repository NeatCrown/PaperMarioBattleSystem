Shelled and Winged Enemy Implementation (3/19/17)
-------------------------------------------------
Specific Physical Attributes on enemies in the first two PM games have unique properties.

Overview
--------
Shelled enemies like Koopa Troopas and Buzzy Beetles can be flipped on their backs if hit with a move that attacks from above,
such as Jump or Sky Dive. After a few turns, these enemies will get back up. If already flipped, these moves will refresh the turn count for
them getting back up.

Enemies like Clefts and Bristles can also be flipped, but that only occurs when they're hit with anything that deals Explosive damage,
not with a particular type of contact.

Additionally, Winged enemies like Paragoombas and Parakoopas fall to the ground when attacked from above and take on the appearance and
information (tattle, stats, etc.) of their grounded versions, Goombas and Koopas respectively. All moves in the PM games that flip a Shelled
enemy also remove a Winged enemy's wings, but they are inherently separate. Stilt Guys act exactly the same as any Winged enemy, with their
grounded versions being Shy Guys.

However, Kammy Koopa in TTYD is a bit different in that her tattle, name and other information is exactly the same. Furthermore, she gets back
on her broom, becoming airborne again, after a few turns of being grounded.

Needs
-----
So what we need is the following:

1. A way to tell a BattleEntity to flip over when hit with a specific ContactType or Element.
2. A way to have the BattleEntity unflip after a designated turn count.
3. A way to tell a BattleEntity to lose its wings when hit with a specific ContactType.
4. A way to tell the BattleEntity which information to use when Grounded. For Kammy Koopa, we can just use the same information.
5. A way to have the BattleEntity go back to flying after a designated turn count. This applies to Kammy Koopa.
